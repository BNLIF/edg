This is the repo for the [EDG homepage](https://www.phy.bnl.gov/edg/). Anybody in the [BNLIF](https://github.com/BNLIF) organization can edit the repo. To become a member, contact any [existing owner](https://github.com/orgs/BNLIF/people?query=role%3Aowner).

## Editing Instructions

The repo uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to automatically publish the website after each commit. Currently, we have the following pages that can be edited:
 * [index.md](index.md)
 * [people.md](people.md)
 * [links.md](links.md)
 * [sidebar](_layouts/default.html)

You can edit the file directly in the web browser (click the pencil icon that says "Edit this file" on the file's page). After you commit the changes, GitHub Pages will rebuild the website and the new content should be available within a few minutes.
